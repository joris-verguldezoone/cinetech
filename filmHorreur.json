Quite what it was - I can't remember, but it _was_ important enough to go down stream in search of him.\r\n\r\nSheen's character decides to head down river with his fellow soldiers and seek out the bald lunatic before its too late. Robert Duvall is hilarious as a war immune soldier - especially when a shell explodes near him and he merely gives it a disinterested glance. Amusing!\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though, this is a ponderous trip - the film seems to meander aimlessly with little to keep this viewer interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ian Beale","created_at":"2017-02-14T20:24:32.034Z","id":"58a36780c3a3683eff000767","updated_at":"2017-02-14T20:34:24.258Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a36780c3a3683eff000767"}]
